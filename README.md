# DRESS

Based off of Joe Mango's code for the DRESS system found here: https://github.com/JmangoITP/DRESS

The DRESS system is an early prototype to help caretakers of dementia patients take better care of their patients. Caretakers often find that patients have a difficult time getting dressed, and due to the private nature of the activity, caretakers often find friction when they are present to help their patients get dressed. The DRESS system aims to offer two solutions to this problem. The first solution is an automatic solution in which fiducial markers are on the patient's clothes and we use computer vision to detect when a garment is properly worn. The second solution is a manual solution in which the caretaker can observe the patient through telepresence and walk the patient through the process.  

The DRESS system can now:
* trigger lights to indicate which dresser to open
* read Fiducial markers using Reactivision
* send video feeds to the caretaker interface

Built with Node and Arduino
